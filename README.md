# AI-Powered Electricity Price Forecasting

## 1. Understanding Business Problem, Business Objectives & constraints, Success Criterias
### Business Problem
In power trading, price volatility and demand-supply imbalances create significant financial risks for market participants. Accurately forecasting electricity prices, demand patterns, and renewable energy generation can enhance decision-making for utilities, grid operators, and power traders. The challenge lies in integrating multiple data sources, handling market uncertainties, and optimizing trading strategies in real-time.
### Business Objective
Minimizing financial risks and procurement costs in power trading.

### Business Constraint
Maximize trading returns.

### Success Criteria
- **Business Success Criteria**: At least 15 - 20% reduction in financial risks due to price volatility, leading to increased profitability for power traders and utilities.
- **Machine Learning Success Criteria**: Achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 10% compared to baseline models.
- **Economic Success Criteria**: Optimized trading strategies leading to 5 - 10% savings in energy procurement costs and a 10 - 15% increase in returns from power trading.

## 2. Project architecture (HLD)
Using Draw.io, created project architecture. Architecture contains CRISP-ML(Q) type flow.

## 3. Articles Collection
Collected project related articles from differenet websites like google scholor, medium etc. Collect useful insights like models, evaluation metrics, datasets etc.

## 4. Data Collection 
Firstly, we identified the features related to business problem and we collect data from the web(primary Data collection). Took data from the IEX website and data sending and retreving to sql database.

## 5. Environment Creation
creating environment in command prompt and installing required libraries
